# Whistler

This was created while learning Node App Development.

This is a social media backend example with users, posts and hastags.

The app structure is fairly simple and has unit tests written for all the modules. 
The ORMManager from this project is something I still use in one of out products. Will try to update this documentation furthur.

For any queries or help feel free to mail me @satis.vishnu@gmail.com
